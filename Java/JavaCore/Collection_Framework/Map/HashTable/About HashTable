DEFINITION :
>>
   HashTable is the synchronized or Thread-safe version of HashMap that store a group of individual objects in
   key-value pair .




FEATURES:
>>
    1. It is legacy class, means comes in Java 1.0 Version
    2. It is synchronised version of HashMap , means it is thread safe
    3. It cannot store null like HashMap
    4. Readability and Performance low than HashMap
    5. Serializable , Cloneable but not Random Access
    6. It can hold Heterogeneous objects
    7. Insertion Order not preserved based on HashCode


HIERARCHY:
>>


         Map -----
                 ----> HashTable(L) ---> Properties(L)
    Dictionary (L) ---



SIZE AND INSERTION PROCESS:
>>
   The underlying data structure of HashTable is HashTable where keys are stored according to Hash Code which is
   defined by modulo.

   Default Size of HashTable is -   11
                     Fill Ratio - 0.75
