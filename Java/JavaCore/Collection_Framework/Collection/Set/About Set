DEFINITION:
>>
   Set is the child interface of JavaCore.Collection_Framework which represents a group of individual objects where duplicates are not
   allowed.



FEATURES:
>>
   1. Set is child interface of JavaCore.Collection_Framework.
   2. Duplicates are not allowed inside Set
   3. Insertion Order is not preserved
   4. Data Stored based on HashCode
   5. Null Insertion Possible
   6. Heterogeneous Object can be inserted
   7. Best of Search Operation - O(1)




SET FAMILY:

 Set(I) --> ( HashSet --> LinkedHashSet , SortedSet --> NavigableSortedSet --> TreeSet )



GENERAL METHODS:
>>
   There are no new methods inside the set method


RESIZING TECHNIQUE :
>>

    In ArrayList/Vector , Capacity expands after capacity is full but in Set, capacity expands after elements are filled
    in a particular percentage/factor of the entire Capacity. This factor is also known as Load factor / Fill Ratio.
    Once elements crossed fill ratio of old capacity , a new HashSet of new capacity is generated and take all elements
    from the old HashSet and old reference variable.

    Load Factor - 0.x means New Set will be created after filling 0.x times filling of initial capacity

    After reaching Load factor , a new Set will be created with New Capacity of CurrentCapacity*2
