DEFINITION:
>>
   List is the child interface of Collection which represents a group of individual objects as single entity
   where duplicates are allowed and insertion order is preserved.




FEATURES:
>>
    1. List is child interface of Collection.
    2. List supports duplicate values
    3. List preserves insertion order
    4. Insertion order of List is preserved by "index"




LIST FAMILY:


List(I) --> ( ArrayList , LinkedList, Vector --> Stack )




GENERAL METHODS:
>>

   1. As List is the child interface of Collection , List holds all 12 methods of collections
   2. " index" follows a crucial play in list , So List has some unique methods associated with "index"



   >> ADDING OPERATION WITH INDEX

    1. list.add ( int index, Object o)                   --> add Object in a specific index
    2. list.addAll ( int index , Collection c)           --> add Collection in a specific index


  >> REMOVING OPERATIONS WITH INDEX

    3. list.remove ( int index , Object O)               --> remove Object from a specific index
    4, list.removeAll ( int index, Collection C)         --> remove Colelction from a specific index


  >> RETRIEVAL & REPLACE OPERATION

    5. get ( int index )                                 --> retrieve Object from specific index
    6. set ( int index, Object O)                        --> retrieve and then replace object in a specific index
    7. indexOf ( Object O)                               --> check and returns index for first occurrence
    8. lastIndexOf ( Object O)                           --> check and return index for last occurrence
