DEFINITION:
>>
   ArrayList is a pre-defined java class implementing List interface inside " java.util" package
   which holds a list of individuals object where duplicates are not allowed and insertion order
   is preserved by indexing.





FEATURES:
>>
    1. ArrayList is a class pre-defined in java.util package implements List interface. So, ArrayList
       holds all properties of list too.
    2. ArrayList also known as " Resizable Array"
    3. Null Insertion is possible
    4. ArrayList also implements RandomAccess , so we can have faster retrieval operations






HOW RESIZING IS DONE :
>>
    ArrayList is also known as "Resizable Array". Arrays has the main problem of being fixed in size. However,
    ArrayList dynamically increases its size once it fills its  capacity.

    For the first time,
    -> ArrayList has  size of - 0 when creating with "new" operator

    Once an element is added for the first time ,
    -> ArrayList initiates with default size of - 10

    Once the 10th element is inserted and the 11th element is about to inserted
    -> A new Arraylist of size ( Current Capacity * 1.5 ) +1 is created and in the new ArrayList all the
       previous old elements are copied in the new ArrayList and updates the reference variable
       to point to the new ArrayList where the old Arraylist is collected by Garbage collector.

   These Process is also known as - " Dynamic Array Resizing " or " Array Capacity Expansion"


         a-->   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
                _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _                   ( 10 capacity)


                 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
                 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
         a-->    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( 16 capacity )






ARRAYLIST'S ADVANTAGE IS THE ARRAYLIST'S PROBLEM:
>>
    Every time, when the size exceeds the ArrayList capacity , a new larger sized ArrayList is created with
    extra capacity which may or may not be used. This caused Memory fragmentation problems and also memory
    wastage problem which is not a good programming practice.

    That is why, if we know the size of ArrayList or can predict size range , it is better to choose Array
    or ArrayList with own initial capacity to prevent memory wastage.
