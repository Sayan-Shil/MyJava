DEFINITION:
>>
   Collection is a Java Interface inside " java.util " package which represents a group of individual objects.




FEATURES:
>>
   1. Collections are growable in nature unlike Arrays which are limited in size
   2. Collections allocates memory according to input data. So Memory wise, Collections are
      better.
   3. Collections can hold Object heterogeneous types
   4. Collection can have type-safety like Arrays with the help of generics
   5. In ArrayList, Underlying Data Structure available .
   6. It implements Serializable for serializations and Cloneable for cloning operations





COLLECTION FAMILY:
>>
Collection(I) --> List(I) --> ( ArrayList , LinkedList, Vector --> Stack )
Collection(I) --> Set(I) --> ( HashSet --> LinkedHashSet , SortedSet --> NavigableSortedSet --> TreeSet )
Collection(I) --> Queue(I) --> (  PriorityQueue , BlockingQueue --> (PriorityBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue))





GENERAL METHODS OF COLLECTION INTERFACE:
>>
   In the Collection interface inside "java.util" package , there are 12 pre-defined methods which also are
   inherited to all other child-interfaces classes which implements Collection Interface internally. Which
   means that these general methods can be invoked by all classes which implements Collection interfaces or
   its child interfaces



   >> ADDING OPERATIONS

   1. add (Object O)               --> add Object inside collection
   2. addAll (Collection c)        --> add Collection inside collection


   >> REMOVING OPERATIONS

   3. remove (Object O)            --> remove Object from Collection
   4. removeAll (Collection c)     --> remove Collection from Collection
   5. clear ()                     --> clears entire Collection
   6. retainAll (Collection c)     --> Except Collection , remove everything


   >> SEARCHING OPERATIONS

   7. contains (Object O)          --> check if object is available or not
   8. containsALL( Collection c)   --> check if collection is available or not


   >> SIZING

   9. size ()                      --> returns size of the collections
   10. isEmpty()                   --> check if size is 0 or empty


   >> CONVERSION AND ITERATIONS

   11. toArray()                   --> Convert Collection To Array
   12. iterator()                  --> Initialise Iterator inside Collection
