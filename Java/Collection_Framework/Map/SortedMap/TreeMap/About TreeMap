DEFINITION
>>
   TreeMap is the pre-defined class inside java.util package that holds Entry Objects to represent an individual group
   of objects based on key-value pair.
   It implemented SortedSet before , then implemented NavigableMap which further extends SortedMap after Java 6






FEATURES:
>>
     1. Pre-defined class of java.util package implements NavigableMap
     2. Underlying Data Structure - Red-Black Tree
     3. Duplicate Key not possible but values are possible
     4. If we want to depend on Default Natural Sorting Map , keys must be homogeneous ,Or ClassCastException
     5. If we can define how to compare different type of object via comparator then , Keys can be Heterogeneous
