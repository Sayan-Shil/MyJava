BIRTH OF C : FATHER OF MODERN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
---------------------------------------------------

To create more freedom for experimenting of computer machines , the market introduces the father of all modern programming
language - C.

Dennis Ritchie successfully invented the first modern programming language C on the DEC PDP-11 Machine , a mini-computer
with 16-bit architecture system running on UNIX operating system.

C was the developed version of its old grandpa language BCPL ( Basic Combined Programming Language ) , developed by
Martin Richards in 1960s. And also BCPL was not the first one, itself influenced by grand grandpa language
of C , B Programming Language by Ken Thompson.

B --> BCPL --> C

But, C was formally standardized in December,1989 by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan.
