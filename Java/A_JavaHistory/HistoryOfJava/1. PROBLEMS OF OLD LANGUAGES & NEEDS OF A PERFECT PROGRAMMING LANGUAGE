PROBLEMS OF OLD LANGUAGES & NEEDS OF A PERFECT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As soon as computer designers were thinking to move the computer technology not only keep inside the dummy box ,
it should access to the beyond of hardware. The concepts of software were rapidly flourished as programmers required 
a perfect language to be used so that the practice of coding changed and there can be a revolution in programming 
so that programmers can gain unlimited access to their machines.

Main Features they require
>> Easy to use but powerful
>> Secure as well as efficient
>> Rigidity as well as extensibility

As in market, there were already some programming language but do not have entirely 6 key features.
FORTRAN - efficiency issues in scientific works , Bad for system code
BASIC   - easy to use but very weak programming language
Assembly - powerful language but very difficult to use , also debugging is difficult

Also,
all languages had some severe issues like

1. FORTRAN,COBOL,BASIC languages lacks "Structured Principles" designs
2. They heavily depend on GOTO or jump to execution , so issues arises called "Spaghetti Code"
3. "Spaghetti Codes" creates  mass tangled jumps and conditional branches that make a program virtually impossible to
    understand


Pascals comes in the market with "Structured Principles" but have poor efficiency problems and fails in wide range
of programming.
