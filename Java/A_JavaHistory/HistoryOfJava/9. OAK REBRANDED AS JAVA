9. OAK REBRANDED AS JAVA
----------------------------

Our Java would never to be said as Java if there was no pre-existed company called " Oak Technology " renowned for
manufacturing multimedia hardware and software. In 1995, this gave concern to Oak team in Sun Microsystems and to avoid
trademark dispute issues , the name of the language had to change before public launch of Oak .

The developers working on the Oak programming language were avid coffee drinkers. When Sun Microsystems suggested to
rebranded the name of Oak , they put some names suggested like

1. GREEN : As the name of their "Green Project"
2. DNA : To emphasize DNA of Software
3. WebRunner : Name suggested for web running compatibility of java
4. Java : Just a brainstorming name

Most of the developers chose Java as new name to keep the name more easy to remember as well as gratitude to daily
coffee.
