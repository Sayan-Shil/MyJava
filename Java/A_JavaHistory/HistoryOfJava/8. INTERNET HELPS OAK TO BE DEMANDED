8. INTERNET HELPS OAK TO BE DEMANDED
------------------------------------

The "Portable Programming" or "Platform Independent"  worlds were as elusive as they are desirable . though the quest
for portable, platform independent language was not the first time though but was an old idea to run code efficiently in
all platforms. However, it was not a priority to the programmers too much as at that time, the world was largely divided
into three competitive camps of Intel , Macintosh and UNIX and they stayed within their forfeited boundaries.

Oak was not prioritised initially as platform independence was not important at that time. Also, Oak was designed to
small scale , initially developed for use in consumer electronics, specifically for interactive TV, set-top boxes and
small video games.

However, after 1993, arrival of the World Wide Web changed the scenario . The internet consists of diverse,distributed
universe populated with various computers , operating systems and CPUs. This led an emergency requirement of platform
independent language. Oak developers didn't miss the opportunity.

Internet causes the Oak developers to switch from electronics consumers to Internet programming . This led a massive
attraction towards the programmers. As well as, Java was not intended to replace C,C++ rather than wanted to enhance
it to become more strong. Some people that is why says Java as "Online/Internet Version of C++" . However, there is large
changes inside Java from C++ having separate philosophical and practical differences.
