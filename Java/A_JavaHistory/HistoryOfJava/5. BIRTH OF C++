5. BIRTH OF C++ :
---------------------------------------

To solve the "Spaghetti Coding" problems , in 1960 there was a concept initiated called " Structure Programming" with
Structural principle. C follows the structure programming strictly as moderately complex problems can easily be written
in the language. However, Structural language performs very poor and more complex when projects increases size.
So, for the structure level, there required new concept , which was further to be known as OOP (Object Oriented
Programming ) .
OOP is a programming methodology that helps organise modern programs through the use of inheritance , encapsulations,
and polymorphisms.

C++ , implementing OOP structure breaks the threshold at which program become unmanageable.

C++ was invented by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 during working at Bell Laboratory in Murray Hill , New Jersey.
First name was suggested to be C with Classes when in 1983, it was changed to C++ means C by adding oop features.
The fact is that Stroustrup never wanted to create a entirely new language but add OOPs inside C.

That is why still today, C and C++ is like " Inseparable brothers "
